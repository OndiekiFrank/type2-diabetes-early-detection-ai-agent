#  Research Findings & Clinical Insights

##  Comprehensive Research Analysis
![Product Features](Images/Age.png)  
###  Epidemiological Findings
- **Age as Primary Risk Amplifier**: Diabetes prevalence increases dramatically after age 45, with metabolic efficiency declining by 15-20% per decade
- **BMI Threshold Effects**: Clear dose-response relationship identified - each 5-unit BMI increase elevates diabetes risk by 60%
- **African-Specific Patterns**: Urban populations show 3.6x higher prevalence than rural areas, highlighting urbanization impact

###  Metabolic Pathway Insights
![Product Features](Images/BoxPlots.png) 
- **Glucose Metabolism Dysregulation**: Fasting glucose levels >100 mg/dL represent prediabetes stage with 25% progression risk within 3-5 years
- **Insulin Resistance Markers**: Postprandial glucose spikes indicate early pancreatic exhaustion, detectable 5-7 years before clinical diagnosis
- **Lipid Metabolism Abnormalities**: Low HDL (<40 mg/dL) and high triglycerides (>150 mg/dL) manifest 2-3 years before diabetes onset

###  Lifestyle Impact Analysis
![Product Features](Images/BMI.png) 
- **Physical Activity Correlation**: Each 2-hour daily sedentary behavior increases diabetes risk by 20%
- **Dietary Risk Quantification**: Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption shows 26% risk increase per daily serving
